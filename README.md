## 1) Overview
This lab adds finishing touches to a Power BI report to improve the end-user experience:
- A clearly labeled **Information button** with my name
- Thoughtful **slicers** and **date filtering**
- Clean, readable visuals users can navigate without guidance

- Page: *Sales and Profit*
- Visual: Insert → Buttons → **Information**
- Title: `Info — Rachel Goldsbury`

**B) Slicers & Date Filter**
- **Order Date** slicer set to **December 2018** (bottom-left)

**C) Expanded Visual**
- **Sales & Profit by Customer Name, Region, Order Date** expanded for review

## 3) Why these UX pieces matter
